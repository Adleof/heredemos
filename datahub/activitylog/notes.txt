This demo will help show how the activity log works. My space will consist of 5 cats with properties:

name
gender
mood

How to make the space:

I used this: https://xyz.api.here.com/token-ui/spacemgmt.html

Main space: QUrgUIm1
AL space: R573F24U


The script I will write will do this each execution:

get all cats
randomly change mood
randomly (possibly) move them +- a few points of lat/lng


LOG:
output1.geojson, output of AL space after seeding Main space with seed.geojson
