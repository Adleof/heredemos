### Build Your Own Isoline Routing Tool

The purpose of this project is to be a "seed project" for people who want to build their own Isoline 
routing web application using HERE's [Isoline routing](https://developer.here.com/documentation/isoline-routing-api/dev_guide/index.html) product. The code and assets here are *not* meant to be used alone, but rather to help you get 
started building your own project, hopefully with minimal work.

You can see a simple demo of this in action in the [demo](./demo) subdirectory. You can view the online version here:
